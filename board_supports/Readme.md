Here is the 3D model of a minimalist support that I designed for [Nucleo-64](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/data_brief/c8/3c/30/f7/d6/08/4a/26/DM00105918.pdf/files/DM00105918.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00105918.pdf) development boards. It prevents the pins at the bottom from touching the table. The two STL files are for your 3D printing slicer tool. The FreeCAD model file is included in case you want to make modifications. You will need 3 screws with 2.5 mm diameter and a maximum length of 8 mm to attach the parts to the board.
